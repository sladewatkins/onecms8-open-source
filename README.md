# OneCMS 8 - Open Source Components
Open source components bundled with OneCMS 8 (and later).

## Why does this repository exist?
OneCMS 8's initial release will not be open source at this time (could change in the future, see below section), but does utilize open source components for certain features. They are, however, not bundled with the actual release. Therefore, the bundles we use will be contained within this repository for license compliance purposes.

## OneCMS 7 was open source (the first version to be available publicly), why isn't OneCMS 8 open source?
Unfortunately, a lot of the base of OneCMS 8 uses proprietary APIs and code that has not been licensed for public release, so we had to make the difficult decision to pull OneCMS's code private. We're hoping it's a temporary thing while we work out licensing (or replacing the APIs ourselves with a version owned and controlled by us), and if something changes, we'll be doing so in a point release (8.**y**) so that we can make the proprietary license invalid. More details on that will come in the future.

## So, will OneCMS 8 ever be open source?
That's the hope. Building with the community is something we *want* to do, but as stated, it isn't possible right this second. Rest assured it's on the roadmap.
